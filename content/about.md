Jonny Law is a data scientist at the [National Innovation Centre for Data](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/nicd/), working with local and national companies to allow them to make the most of their data. Previously he was a Statistics PhD student on the [Cloud Computing for Big Data CDT](http://www.bigdata-cdt.ac.uk/). His primary research interest is in using functional programming for Bayesian Inference (often called probabilistic programming), using [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/).
